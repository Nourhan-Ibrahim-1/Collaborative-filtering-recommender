# Collaborative Filtering-based Recommendation System

##  Project Description
This project implements a **Collaborative Filtering Recommendation System** using the **MovieLens 100K** dataset.  
It predicts user preferences for movies based on their past interactions and the behaviors of similar users or items.

We implemented:
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** (UBCF)
- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** (IBCF)
- Evaluation metrics such as **RMSE**, **Precision@K**, and **Recall@K**
- Optional visualization of user similarities and model performance
